# Getting started

This documentation will guide you to make your own story teller. You can choose between a purely software version (for deskto, mobile or command line), or a hardware version with electronics boards, wires and mechanical enclosure.

## Links

Before starting, here is a complete list of links where you'll find project information:

- :octopus: [Github](https://github.com/arabine/open-story-teller): source code for the firmware, the player and the story editor, issue tracking
- [Itch.io](https://d8s-apps.itch.io/open-story-teller): Download page for the Story Editor and various player versions.

## Helping

You can help in various ways:

- Report bugs on Github (open an new issue)
- Propose patches, ideas, mechanical drawings, ports (open an issue)
- Translate stuff

## Where to start

Before building your own hardware, make sure you have a minimal knowledge of basic electronics. You may have to solder some wires, but nothing's complicated.

The general procedure is:
1. Choose your hardware bundle and buy parts
2. Follow the guidelines to assemble your device
3. Flash the last firmware binary available for your bundle
4. Use the StoryEditor to create your first story
5. Copy the story pack onto the SD-Card memory
6. Enjoy

## How much does it cost?

Without the enclosure, you can expect something between 30 € and 50 € depending on your hardware choices. Try to reuse a maximum of spare parts to lower the price (resistors, buttons...).

## What tools do I need?

It is not exhaustive but here is a minimal list:
- Soldering station
- Solder
- Resistors
- USB cables
- Jumper cables
- Headers
- Prototype boards

## What about the software player?

The software player is free and open source, you can rebuild it from the source code or download prebuild releases. See dedicated section.

# Mechanical enclosure

Not yet, waiting for the availability of the first complete kit to determine the form factor.

# Planned ideas

- ESP32 target (low cost and  high availability)
- Add a microphone
- Mobile version with text-to-speach and voice recognition
- Propose to buy a PCB for I/O connections (buttons, rotary, LED...)
